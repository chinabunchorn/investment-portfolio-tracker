Personal Portfolio Tracker MVP

The Reason why I built this: I needed a lightweight tool to track my portfolio, which uses many brokers.

I invest in both US stocks (Dime) and Cryptocurrency (Binance).
These assets are highly volatile and correlated, but the data is stored in separate platforms.
Because of this, I cannot clearly see my total portfolio risk. I regularly invest using DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging).
I want to be able to add and track transactions manually, store them in a database, and keep them as evidence for tax filing(further, when I have a salary).

My portfolio includes assets in both THB and USD.
To see the real portfolio value, I need to calculate it using real-time FX rates, not just the numbers shown by brokers or exchanges.

Most portfolio-tracking tools in the market are monthly subscription-based.
As a student, I want to save costs, so I decided to build this system myself.
